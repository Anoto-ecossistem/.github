## Anoto

###
This organization is like a notebook where we find several projects

We are evolving into a learning community focused on collaboration, curiosity, and continuous growth.<br> 
Our mission is to create open-source projects, share knowledge, and support developers and learners of all levels on their journeys.<br>
Here at Anoto, we also focus on learning how to study better—based on evidence-based study methods and scientific research.<br>
Join us as we build, learn, and grow together.
